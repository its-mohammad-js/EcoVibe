Eco Vibe is an innovative platform that merges e-commerce functionality with social media features. It allows users to browse and purchase a wide range of products, while also enabling sellers to manage their inventory, track orders, and interact with customers. Sellers' activities are presented as content creation within their dedicated profiles, which are inspired by Instagram. The platform is designed to create a seamless shopping experience enhanced by features such as real-time chat, product reviews, and the ability to post and engage with stories. Eco Vibe ensures a fast, scalable, and interactive user experience.
